# Mail server

## Why I need it

You will need to have SMTP \( way to send mail \) because the system will use it to

* Send password reset email
* Order related notifications 
* Restaurant owner registration
* Driver registration

#### SMTP from shared hosting

This is probably the easiest way to obtain SMTP data. Create an email in your hosting and get note of the credentials. You will need them in the install process.

#### 3rd Party SMTP providers like SendGrid

SendGrid is the leading SMTP provider. Easy to set up and reliable service.
